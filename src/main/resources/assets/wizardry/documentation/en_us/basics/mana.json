        "Of all the energy sources a wizard can draw on, mana is the safest and most available. Although it takes a trained wizard to manipulate it, crystal clear pools of this watery liquid can be found naturally. It can also manifest itself in people and objects, giving a trained wizard a constant source of energy to draw on. A mage who knows how to utilise mana is rarely powerless, and even if you are able to attack a fellow wizard when they are unprepared, they will still pose a threat.",
        "It is wise to beware the temptation to be too greedy, however; nothing covered by the art of wizardry comes without cost, and even good things can be dangerous in large doses. The dangers of mana come twofold.",
        "Firstly, a wizard who tries to cast too much too fast using mana is in danger of overloading themselves; they will find that the more they use, the less effective each spell is. This is commonly referred to as ‘burnout’, because although wizards possess the power to shake the earth and move the heavens, they are very, very bad at names.",
        "Secondly, it is possible to overload on mana. The body can only store a certain amount before it starts to present with side effects. These are commonly not dissimilar to those you may experience if you ingest certain chemicals, and range from mildly annoying to severely unpleasant.",
        "Please also note that, despite the superficial similarity to water, drinking naturally occurring raw mana is not recommended, and may cause insanity, death, or a fondness for bad puns."
